# VN-Index Prediction with Bi-LSTM

## 📌 Introduction
This project applies a **Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)** model to predict the VN-Index, Vietnam’s benchmark stock index.  
It covers the full workflow: data cleaning, analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Load and clean VN-Index data  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering for time-series format  
4. Build and train Bi-LSTM model  
5. Evaluate with RMSE & visualize predictions  

## 📊 Features
- End-to-end pipeline for financial time-series forecasting  
- Bi-LSTM captures forward & backward dependencies  
- Visual comparison of actual vs predicted VN-Index
